# Attack Range Docs

The Splunk Attack Range is an open-source project maintained by the Splunk Threat Research Team. It builds instrumented cloud and local environments, simulates attacks, and forwards the data into a Splunk instance. This environment can then be used to develop and test the effectiveness of detections.

The Attack Range is a detection development platform, which solves three main challenges in detection engineering:
* The user is able to quickly build a small lab infrastructure as close as possible to a production environment.
* The Attack Range performs attack simulation using different engines such as Atomic Red Team or Caldera in order to generate real attack data. 
* It integrates seamlessly into any Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the detection rule testing process.
